# Tuto

This was created as a team project for the [National University of Singapore (NUS) CS2103T Software Engineering course](https://nus-cs2103-ay2526s1.github.io/website/index.html).

Tuto is a command-line interface (CLI) address book for tutors to efficiently manage their students, including tracking attendance, performance, and fees.

## Other Details
* It is **written in OOP fashion**. It provides a **reasonably well-written** code base **bigger** (around 6 KLoC) than what students usually write in beginner-level SE modules, without being overwhelmingly big.
* It comes with a **reasonable level of user and developer documentation**.
* For the detailed documentation of this project, see the **[Tuto Product Website](https://ay2526s1-cs2103t-f10-3.github.io/tp/)**.
* This project is a **part of the se-education.org** initiative. If you would like to contribute code to this project, see [se-education.org](https://se-education.org/#contributing-to-se-edu) for more info.
