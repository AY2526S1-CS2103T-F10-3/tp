## **Design**

### Architecture

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.puml" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete s/0000`.

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.puml" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.)

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<puml src="diagrams/ComponentManagers.puml" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

<puml src="diagrams/UiClassDiagram.puml" alt="Structure of the UI Component"/>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/LogicClassDiagram.puml" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete s/0002")` API call as an example.

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteStudentSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete s/0002` Command" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</box>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<puml src="diagrams/ParserClasses.puml" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note on Extra Parameters:** When users provide extra parameters beyond what a command expects, the parser's `ArgumentTokenizer` treats any unrecognized text (including invalid parameter prefixes) as part of the value of the parameter that precedes it. This means that if an invalid or unrecognized parameter is added after a valid parameter, the validation error message will reference the valid parameter that comes immediately before the invalid input, rather than indicating that extra parameters were provided. Developers should be aware of this behavior when designing commands and crafting error messages, as it may affect how validation errors are communicated to users.

</box>

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<puml src="diagrams/ModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores a list of `ClassTag` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueClassTagList` object).
* manages fee-related data through the `FeeTracker`, which records each student's monthly `FeeState` (`PAID` or `UNPAID`) and supports derived payment status queries.
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<puml src="diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.puml" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)
* manages serialization of complex model data as part of the Address Book:
    * The `UniqueClassTagList` is stored within the Address Book JSON file.  
      Conversion is handled by `JsonAdaptedClassTag`, and `JsonSerializableAddressBook` includes the `classTags` list during serialization and deserialization.
    * Each `Person` is serialized using `JsonAdaptedPerson`, which in turn serializes:
        * `JsonAdaptedAttendance` — attendance data
        * `JsonAdaptedFeeRecord` — fee payment records
        * `JsonAdaptedPerformanceNote` — performance-related notes
        * and associated class tags (`JsonAdaptedClassTag`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

</box>

### Student Management

#### Overview

The Student Management feature allows tutors to manage student records efficiently.  
Key operations include **adding, editing, and deleting students**.

Each student is uniquely identified by a **Student ID** and can have associated attributes such as **name, phone, email, address, and ClassTags**.

#### Implementation

**Model Component:**
- `Person`: Represents a student with immutable fields:
    - Name, Phone, Email, Address, ClassTags, StudentId, AttendanceList, EnrolledMonth, PerformanceList
- `StudentId`: Ensures uniqueness of students
- `Model` interface provides methods:
    - `addPerson(Person)`: Adds a student
    - `setPerson(Person, Person)`: Updates a student record
    - `deletePerson(Person)`: Deletes a student
    - `hasPerson(Person)`: Checks for duplicate student
    - `hasPersonWithId(StudentId)`: Checks existence of student by ID
    - `getPersonById(StudentId)`: Retrieves student by ID
- `AttendanceList` and `PerformanceList` maintain attendance and performance records

**Storage Component:**
- `JsonAdaptedPerson`: Converts Person objects to/from JSON
- `JsonSerializableAddressBook`: Serializes the student list along with ClassTag references
- Deserialization restores each student’s data, including personal details, ClassTag references, and fee records.

**Logic Component:**

1. **AddCommand (`add`)**: Adds a new student
    - Validates all fields (Name, Phone, Email, Address, EnrolledMonth, ClassTags)  
    - Ensures no duplicate students
    - Checks all ClassTags exist before assignment
    - Automatically assigns a unique Student ID
    - Updates the model with the new student

2. **EditCommand (`edit`)**: Modifies existing student details
    - Identifies student by Student ID
    - Edits any combination of fields (Name, Phone, Email, Address, ClassTags)
    - Validates all input fields and ClassTags
    - Empty ClassTag list (`t/`) removes all ClassTag assignments
    - Prevents duplicate records after editing

3. **DeleteCommand (`delete`)**: Removes a student
    - Identifies student by Student ID
    - Ensures the student exists before deletion
    - Updates model to remove the student
   
4. **ListCommand (`list`)**: Displays all students
    - Clears any active filters from previous `find` commands
    - Shows the complete list of students stored in the model

5. **FindCommand (`find`)**: Searches for students by keywords
    - Supports keyword-based matching on Name field
    - Case-insensitive search
    - Displays a filtered list of matching students

6. **ClearCommand (`clear`)**: Clears all student records
    - Removes all students from the model

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteStudentSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="DeleteStudentSequenceDiagram" />

#### Design Considerations

**Aspect: Phone Number Validation**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Limit to Singapore numbers (8 digits, starting with 6, 8, or 9)
    * Pros: Ensures only valid Singapore phone numbers are accepted, prevents accidental entry of incorrect numbers
    * Cons: Cannot accept overseas numbers

* **Alternative 2:** Allow any numeric input of 8–10 digits
    * Pros: More flexible, supports overseas or mobile numbers with country codes
    * Cons: Less strict, may allow invalid or mistyped numbers



**Aspect: Name Validation**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Only alphabetic characters, spaces, hyphens, and apostrophes; max 200 characters
    * Pros: Prevents invalid or malicious input, ensures readability and consistent formatting
    * Cons: Cannot accept names with unusual symbols outside this set

* **Alternative 2:** Allow any Unicode characters, with length limit
    * Pros: Supports all valid names globally
    * Cons: May allow emojis or unexpected symbols, harder to validate and may affect GUI display

**Aspect: Address Validation**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Accepts alphanumeric characters, `#`, `-`, `,`, `'` and spaces
    * Pros: Covers most Singapore addresses while keeping input simple and consistent
    * Cons: Cannot accept exotic symbols or foreign address formats

* **Alternative 2:** Free-text input
    * Pros: Maximum flexibility
    * Cons: Harder to validate and maintain consistent formatting and may cause GUI display issues

**Aspect: Email Validation**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use detailed format rules — the part before “@” allows letters, numbers, and the symbols `+`, `_`, `.`, and `-`.  
  The domain part after “@” is made up of labels separated by dots, and the last label must be at least 2 characters long.
    * Pros: Ensures proper email format, prevents invalid entries, aligns with common standards
    * Cons: Slightly complex regex, may reject rare valid emails, such as:
      - `john_doe@example.com` (underscore in local part)
      - `"john.doe"@example.com` (quoted local part)
      - `alice+mailbox/department@example.com` (slashes in local part)
      - `a@b.c` (final domain label less than 2 characters)
      - `test@sub_domain.example.com` (underscore in domain label)
      - `üser@exämple.com` (non-ASCII characters)

* **Alternative 2:** Simple regex `.+@.+\..+`
    * Pros: Very permissive, easier to implement
    * Cons: Allows many invalid emails

**Aspect: Enrolled Month Validation**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Format `MMYY`; check valid month and disallow future months
    * Pros: Prevents impossible enrolments, ensures chronological consistency for attendance/performance/fees tracking
    * Cons: Cannot pre-enter future planned enrolments

* **Alternative 2:** Only validate `MMYY` format, allow future months
    * Pros: Can schedule future enrolments, more flexible for planning
    * Cons: Requires additional logic elsewhere to prevent inconsistencies

* **Alternative 3:** Use full date input (`ddMMyy`) instead of `MMYY`
    * Pros: More precise, supports partial months or mid-month enrolment
    * Cons: More cumbersome for users, overkill if month-level granularity is sufficient

**Aspect: ClassTag Validation**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Optional, must exist before assignment
    * Pros: Ensures referential integrity, prevents dangling class references
    * Cons: Adds step to create tag first

* **Alternative 2:** Auto-create class tag if it does not exist
    * Pros: Simplifies user workflow
    * Cons: May create unintended tags, risk of typos creating duplicates

**Aspect: Student ID Assignment**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Auto-generate 4-digit IDs after validating all other fields
    * Pros: Guarantees unique IDs, simple format, avoids hitting maximum limit (9999), no JSON tracking needed
    * Cons: Recycles the highest deleted ID only if it was the latest one and no other add/delete operations occurred before the next app launch

* **Alternative 2:** Store last assigned ID in JSON and always increment
    * Pros: Preserves historical uniqueness across launches
    * Cons: Hits maximum limit faster, extra complexity in JSON handling

* **Alternative 3:** User-specified IDs
    * Pros: Flexibility, users can follow their own numbering system
    * Cons: Higher risk of duplicates and input errors, more complex validation

**Aspect: Non-Duplication of Students**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Uniqueness checked on phone number and name combination
    * Pros: Reduces accidental duplicates while allowing students with same name but different contact details
    * Cons: Cannot detect duplicates with incorrect phone numbers

* **Alternative 2:** Check uniqueness using all fields (name, phone, email, address)
    * Pros: Stronger duplicate detection
    * Cons: More restrictive, may prevent legitimate multiple students with similar details

**Aspect: Enrolled Month Handling**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Set only during creation; cannot be edited afterwards
    * Pros: Simplifies data handling, prevents accidental changes that could affect multiple records
    * Cons: If a wrong month is set, the person must be deleted and recreated to correct it

* **Alternative 2:** Allow editing of enrolled month after creation
    * Pros: More flexible for corrections
    * Cons: Changing enrolled month may affect many associated records, risking data inconsistency

#### Error Handling

**Adding Students:**
- Invalid command format
- Duplicate student record
- Invalid or missing field(s)
- Non-existent ClassTags
- Maximum number of students exceeded (StudentId > 9999)

**Editing Students:**
- Invalid command format
- Student ID not found
- No fields provided to edit
- Invalid input fields or ClassTags
- Resulting record duplicates an existing student

**Deleting Students:**
- Student ID not found
- Invalid command format

**General Validation Rules:**
- Fields are trimmed and validated according to their respective rules
- Commands reject extra/unrecognized input
- All validation errors provide **clear, actionable feedback** to the user

### Attendance Management

#### Overview

The Attendance Management feature enables tutors to track student attendance across different classes and dates. Each attendance record captures whether a student was present or absent for a specific class on a particular date.

#### Implementation

Attendance management is implemented through several key components:

**Model Component:**
- `Attendance`: Represents a single attendance record with a date, ClassTag reference, and status (Present/Absent)
- `AttendanceList`: Maintains all attendance records for a student
- Each `Person` object contains an `AttendanceList` field that stores their attendance history
- The `Model` interface provides methods to retrieve students and validate ClassTags

**Storage Component:**
- `JsonAdaptedAttendance`: Converts Attendance objects to/from JSON format for persistence
- Attendance records are stored within each student's record in the JSON file
- During deserialization, ClassTag references in attendance records are validated against the system's ClassTag list

**Logic Component:**

The following commands handle attendance operations:

1. **AttendanceMarkPresentCommand (triggered by `att -p`)**: Marks a student as present for a class on a specific date
    - Validates student exists and ClassTag exists
    - Prevents duplicate "Present" records (throws error if already marked present)
    - Replaces any existing "Absent" record for the same date and class with a "Present" record

2. **AttendanceMarkAbsentCommand (triggered by `att -a`)**: Marks a student as absent for a class on a specific date
    - Validates student exists and ClassTag exists
    - Prevents duplicate "Absent" records (throws error if already marked absent)
    - Replaces any existing "Present" record for the same date and class with an "Absent" record

3. **AttendanceDeleteCommand (triggered by `att -d`)**: Completely removes an attendance record
    - Validates the attendance record exists
    - Removes the record from the student's AttendanceList
    - Useful for correcting mistakes or handling cancelled classes

4. **AttendanceViewCommand (triggered by `att -v`)**: Displays a student's attendance history
    - Retrieves all attendance records for a specific student
    - Records are sorted by date, then by ClassTag name alphabetically

#### Activity Diagram: Attendance Command Workflow

The activity diagram below illustrates the high-level workflow for attendance management, showing how the system routes different attendance operations based on command flags:

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `AttendanceCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.

</box>


#### Design Considerations

**Aspect: How attendance data is stored:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Store attendance within each `Person` object
  * Pros: Natural encapsulation, easy to retrieve all attendance for a specific student, simpler deletion logic (student deletion automatically removes attendance)
  * Cons: Harder to query attendance across all students for a specific date/class, less efficient for class-centric reports

* **Alternative 2:** Store attendance in a centralized `AttendanceBook`
  * Pros: Easier to query by date/class across all students, better for class-level reports
  * Cons: More complex referential integrity, risk of orphaned records, attendance disconnected from student profiles

#### Error Handling

Attendance operations include comprehensive validation:

**Marking Attendance (Present/Absent):**
- Invalid command format
- Student ID not found
- Invalid Student ID format
- ClassTag does not exist
- ClassTag not assigned to the student
- Date in the future
- Date before student's enrolment month
- Invalid date format (e.g., 30th February, non-existent dates)
- Attempting to mark Present when already marked Present
- Attempting to mark Absent when already marked Absent

**Deleting Attendance:**
- Invalid command format
- Student ID not found
- Invalid Student ID format
- Invalid date format
- Attendance record does not exist for the specified date and class

**Viewing Attendance:**
- Invalid command format
- Student ID not found
- Invalid Student ID format
- No attendance records found for the student (informational message, not an error)

**General Validation Rules:**
- All attendance commands enforce **strict parameter checking** — any extra text beyond the expected format is rejected
- Date validation ensures only real calendar dates are accepted
- ClassTag references are validated against both system-wide ClassTag list and student's assigned tags
- All validation errors provide **clear, actionable feedback** to guide users in correcting their input

### Performance Management

#### Overview

The Performance Notes Management feature lets tutors capture qualitative feedback about a student's progress for specific
classes on particular dates. Each note records the class context, the date of the observation, and a short free-form remark
highlighting achievements or areas for improvement.

#### Implementation

Performance note management is implemented through the following components:

**Model Component:**
- `PerformanceNote`: Represents a single performance entry consisting of a `Date`, `ClassTag`, and note body capped at 200 characters
- `PerformanceList`: Maintains all performance notes for a student, automatically sorting entries by date (ascending) then by class tag name, and preventing duplicate (date, class) pairs
- Each `Person` object embeds a `PerformanceList`, keeping performance history alongside other student attributes
- The `Model` interface exposes helpers to retrieve students, replace updated `Person` instances, and manage the list of performance notes currently shown in the UI (`setDisplayedPerformanceNotes`, `clearDisplayedPerformanceNotes`)

**Storage Component:**
- `JsonAdaptedPerformanceNote`: Serialises/deserializes `PerformanceNote` objects to and from JSON, validating date, class tag, and note length constraints during conversion
- Performance notes are persisted as part of each student's JSON record via `JsonAdaptedPerson`, ensuring notes stay in sync with the owning student
- During deserialization, class tags referenced in performance notes are re-validated against the student's tag set so that orphaned notes cannot be reconstructed

**Logic Component:**

The `perf` command word is a namespace for the following operations:

1. **PerfAddCommand (triggered by `perf -a`)**: Adds a new performance note
    - Validates the student exists and that the specified `ClassTag` belongs to the student
    - Rejects notes dated before the student's enrolment month or in the future
    - Prevents duplicate entries for the same date and class combination
    - Creates a new `PerformanceList` copy, appends the note, re-sorts it, and replaces the student in the model

2. **PerfEditCommand (triggered by `perf -e`)**: Edits an existing performance note's text
    - Validates the student and class tag as per the add command
    - Ensures the targeted note exists before applying the new content and re-validating constraints
    - Persists changes by replacing the student's `PerformanceList` with an updated copy

3. **PerfDeleteCommand (triggered by `perf -d`)**: Removes a performance note entirely
    - Validates the student and class tag and ensures the note exists for the given date/class pair
    - Updates the student's `PerformanceList` without mutating the original list instance

4. **PerfViewCommand (triggered by `perf -v`)**: Displays a student's performance history
    - Retrieves all performance notes for the student and exposes them through `Model#setDisplayedPerformanceNotes`
    - Returns a contextual message indicating whether notes were found, and allows the UI to render the sorted list

#### Sequence Diagram: Adding a Performance Note

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions when a tutor adds a performance note using the `perf -a` command:

<puml src="diagrams/PerformanceAddSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Performance Add Sequence Diagram" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `PerfCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the
lifeline continues till the end of diagram.

</box>

#### Design Considerations

**Aspect: Where performance notes are stored:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Embed performance notes within each `Person`
    * Pros: Keeps academic history co-located with the student profile, simplifies cloning and persistence, and makes student deletion automatically clean up notes
    * Cons: Less efficient for queries that aggregate performance across classes or cohorts, requires iterating through every student for global analytics

* **Alternative 2:** Maintain a central `PerformanceBook`
    * Pros: Facilitates global reporting (e.g. all notes for a class), makes it easier to enforce cross-student constraints
    * Cons: Complicates referential integrity, adds risk of orphaned notes if students are removed, and scatters student-related data

**Aspect: Command structure for performance operations:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Sub-command flags under `perf` (`-a`, `-e`, `-d`, `-v`)
    * Pros: Keeps related operations grouped, mirrors other feature families (`att`, `fee`), and reduces the number of top-level commands to memorise
    * Cons: Requires tutors to remember what each flag stands for and to supply the correct combination of prefixes

* **Alternative 2:** Dedicated verbs per action (`perfadd`, `perfedit`, etc.)
    * Pros: Self-descriptive command words, reduces reliance on flags
    * Cons: Bloats the command set and deviates from the app's namespace-based command organisation

### ClassTag Management

#### Overview

The ClassTag feature allows tutors to organize students into classes or groups. Each ClassTag represents a distinct class (e.g., "Sec_3_A_Math", "P5_Science") that can be assigned to multiple students.

#### Implementation

ClassTag management is implemented through several key components:

**Model Component:**
- `ClassTag`: Represents a class with a unique name
- `UniqueClassTagList`: Maintains all ClassTags in the system, ensuring no duplicates
- The `Model` interface provides methods:
    - `hasClassTag(ClassTag)`: Checks if a ClassTag exists
    - `addClassTag(ClassTag)`: Adds a new ClassTag
    - `deleteClassTag(ClassTag)`: Removes a ClassTag
    - `findClassTag(ClassTag)`: Finds and returns the ClassTag saved in UniqueClassTagList that matches the given ClassTag
    - `getClassTagList()`: Returns an unmodifiable list of all ClassTags
    - `isClassTagInUse(ClassTag)`: Checks if any student is assigned the ClassTag
- `Person` objects maintain a `Set<ClassTag>` field that references ClassTags from the central `UniqueClassTagList`
  
**Storage Component:**
- `JsonAdaptedClassTag`: Converts ClassTag objects to/from JSON format for persistence
- `JsonSerializableAddressBook`: Serializes both the central ClassTag list and student-ClassTag associations
- ClassTags are persisted in two ways:
    1. As a complete list in the `classTags` field of the address book
    2. As references within each student's `tags` field
- During deserialization, ClassTags are loaded first into the system, then students reference them by name

**Logic Component:**

The following commands handle ClassTag operations:

1. **AddClassTagCommand (triggered by `tag -a`)**: Creates a new ClassTag in the system
    - Validates the ClassTag name format (1-30 alphanumeric characters and underscores)
    - Checks for duplicates via `Model#hasClassTag()`
    - Adds to `UniqueClassTagList` via `Model#addClassTag()`

2. **DeleteClassTagCommand (triggered by `tag -d`)**: Deletes an existing ClassTag
    - Validates the ClassTag exists via `Model#findClassTag()`
    - Ensures no students are currently assigned to it
    - Removes from `UniqueClassTagList` via `Model#deleteClassTag()`

3. **ListClassTagCommand (triggered by `tag -l`)**: Lists all ClassTags in the system
    - Retrieves all ClassTags from the Model via `Model#getClassTagList()`
    - Displays them in a numbered list
    - If no tags exist, displays "No class tags found."

4. **ClassTagFilterCommand (triggered by `filter -t`)**: Filters students by ClassTag
    - Validates the ClassTag exists via `Model#findClassTag()`
    - Updates the filtered person list to show only students with that ClassTag

5. **AddCommand**: Adds a new student with optional ClassTag assignments
    - Validates all specified ClassTags exist before creating the student
    - Links student to ClassTags via references

6. **EditCommand**: Edits student details including ClassTag assignments
    - Can add, remove, or replace ClassTag assignments
    - Validates all ClassTags exist before updating
    - Empty ClassTag list (`t/`) removes all ClassTag assignments

#### Design Considerations

**Aspect: ClassTag Storage Architecture:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Central storage in `UniqueClassTagList` with student references
    * Pros:
        - Single source of truth for all ClassTags
        - Enforces uniqueness at system level
        - Prevents orphaned or duplicate ClassTag names
        - Easy to list all classes in the system
        - Referential integrity - can prevent deletion of in-use ClassTags
    * Cons:
        - Requires additional validation when assigning ClassTags to students
        - Slightly more complex implementation

* **Alternative 2:** Store ClassTags only within each Student object
    * Pros:
        - Simpler data structure
        - No need for separate ClassTag list
        - Automatic cleanup when student is deleted
    * Cons:
        - No centralized management or validation
        - Potential for duplicate ClassTag names with slight variations
        - Cannot list all classes without scanning all students
        - Cannot enforce consistent naming
        - No way to track which classes exist in the system

**Aspect: ClassTag Command Design:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Single `tag` command with flags (`-a`, `-d`, `-l`)
    * Pros:
        - Consolidates related operations under one command word
        - Reduces the number of top-level commands users need to remember
        - Clear semantic grouping of ClassTag operations
        - Single ClassTagCommandParser handles all tag operations, reducing parser classes and maintaining consistency
    * Cons:
        - More complex parsing logic to handle different flags

* **Alternative 2:** Separate commands (`addtag`, `deletetag`, `listtag`)
    * Pros:
        - Simpler individual parsers
        - No flag parsing needed
    * Cons:
        - More top-level commands to remember
        - Less semantic grouping

**Aspect: ClassTag Assignment Workflow:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Integrate with Add and Edit commands
    * Pros:
        - Fewer commands for users to learn
        - Natural workflow - assign classes when creating/modifying students
        - Reduces command clutter
    * Cons:
        - Add and Edit commands have more responsibilities
        - More complex command parsing

* **Alternative 2:** Separate AssignClassTag and UnassignClassTag commands
    * Pros:
        - Single responsibility per command
        - Simpler individual command implementations
    * Cons:
        - More commands for users to remember
        - Extra steps in workflow (create student, then assign classes)
        - Verbose for bulk operations
      
**Aspect: Case Sensitivity for ClassTag Comparison:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Case-insensitive comparison while preserving user input casing
    * Pros:
        - Prevents duplicate tags with different cases (e.g., "Math", "math", "MATH" are treated as the same tag)
        - More user-friendly - users don't need to remember exact casing when filtering or assigning tags
        - Preserves the tutor's preferred formatting/casing when they first create the tag (e.g., "Sec_3_A_Math" remains visible as entered)
        - Matches real-world expectations - class names are typically case-insensitive identifiers
    * Cons:
        - Slightly more complex implementation (need to override both `equals()` and `hashCode()` consistently)
        - Users cannot create tags that differ only in case (e.g., cannot have both "Math" and "MATH" as separate tags)

* **Alternative 2:** Normalize all ClassTag names to a single case (e.g., lowercase)
    * Pros:
        - Simpler implementation - no need for special `equals()` and `hashCode()` overrides
        - Completely eliminates case ambiguity
        - Consistent display format across the system
    * Cons:
        - Less flexible - tutors cannot use their preferred casing/formatting
        - May look less professional (e.g., "sec_3_a_math" vs "Sec_3_A_Math")
        - Loses semantic information conveyed through capitalization

* **Alternative 3:** Case-sensitive comparison (exact match required)
    * Pros:
        - Simplest implementation - use default String comparison
        - Allows maximum flexibility for different naming schemes
    * Cons:
        - User-unfriendly - requires remembering exact casing
        - Prone to duplicate tags with slight case variations
        - Could confuse users when "Math" and "math" are treated as different classes
        - More error-prone during filtering and assignment


#### Error Handling

ClassTag operations include comprehensive validation:

**Creating ClassTags:**
- Duplicate ClassTag names (case-insensitive)
- Invalid ClassTag name format (must be 1-30 alphanumeric characters with underscores, no spaces)
- Empty ClassTag name
- Missing or invalid flag

**Deleting ClassTags:**
- Non-existent ClassTag
- ClassTag still assigned to one or more students
- Invalid command format
- Invalid ClassTag format

**Assigning ClassTags to Students:**
- Non-existent ClassTag name when adding/editing students
- Invalid ClassTag format in student commands
- Attempting to assign a ClassTag that doesn't exist

**Filtering by ClassTag:**
- Non-existent ClassTag name
- Invalid command format
- Invalid ClassTag format

**General Validation Rules:**
- All tag commands enforce **strict parameter checking** — any extra text beyond the expected format is rejected
- When multiple flags are present, only the **first valid flag** determines the command type; subsequent flags are treated as invalid parameters and cause the command to fail
- Tag names are trimmed of leading/trailing whitespace before validation

Each validation error provides clear, actionable feedback to help users correct their input.

### Fee Management

#### Overview

The Fee Management feature allows tutors to track, update, and review students’ monthly tuition fee payments.  
Each student has a corresponding `FeeState` (**PAID** or **UNPAID**) for each month starting from their `enrolledMonth`.  
This feature is managed by the central `FeeTracker` component within the `Model`.

#### Implementation

Fee Management is implemented through several key components:

**Model Component:**

- `FeeTracker`: Serves as the central manager for all student fee records.
    - Internally stores data in a nested structure: `Map<StudentId, Map<Month, FeeState>>`, where each student’s fee history is organized by month.
    - The tracker only stores months that have been explicitly marked.
      Any month after enrolment without a record is automatically considered UNPAID by default.
      - Months before a student’s enrolledMonth are excluded from fee tracking, as no payment records exist prior to enrolment.
      - Provides methods to generate payment history between two months.
      - This design avoids redundant data storage and enables on-demand computation of fee states, ensuring efficient lookups and minimal memory use.
      - The `Model` interacts with the `FeeTracker` when marking payments, undoing payments, filtering Paid/Unpaid students, or retrieving historical fee data.

- `FeeState`: Represents a student’s payment status for a particular month. (either PAID or UNPAID)

- `Month`: Represents a calendar month in `MMYY` format and provides utilities for date comparison and traversal.

- `Person`: Each student stores an `enrolledMonth`, which defines when fee tracking begins.  
  Fee states are only derived for months on or after this enrollment month.

- The `Model` interface provides methods:
    - `markPaid(StudentId, Month)`: Marks a student’s fee as Paid for a given month.
    - `markUnpaid(StudentId, Month)`: Marks a student’s fee as Unpaid for a given month.
    - `paidStudents(Month)`: Returns a predicate for filtering students who have Paid for the specified month.
    - `unpaidStudents(Month)`: Returns a predicate for filtering students who have not Paid for the specified month.
    - `getCurrentFeeState(Person)`: Returns the student’s fee state for the current month.
    - `feeStateVersionProperty()`: Returns a read-only observable property that increments whenever fee data changes, allowing the UI to refresh automatically.


**Storage Component:**

- `JsonAdaptedFeeRecord`: Converts fee records to and from JSON format for persistence. Each record stores:
    - `studentId`: the unique identifier of the student,
    - `monthString`: the month in `MMYY` format,
    - `feeState`: the payment status (`PAID` or `UNPAID`).
- `JsonAdaptedPerson`: Serializes each student’s data, including their attendance, performance notes, class tags, and **associated fee records**.
- `JsonSerializableAddressBook`: Handles serialization and deserialization of the entire address book, including all persons, class tags, and fee records.

- During deserialization:
    - The list of `feeRecords` is read first and each entry is re-registered into the in-memory `FeeTracker`.
    - Each person’s `StudentId` is matched to their corresponding fee entries to rebuild accurate payment histories.
    - Any student without explicit fee entries is assumed to have **no recorded payments**, and their post-enrolment months are treated as **UNPAID** by default.

**Logic Component:**

The following commands handle Fee Management operations:

1. **FeeMarkPaidCommand (triggered by `fee -p`)**: Marks a student’s fee as PAID for a specific month.
    - Validates that the student exists via `Model#getPersonById()`.
    - Validates that the target month falls between the student’s enrolled month and the current month (inclusive).
    - Ensures all previous months up to the target month are already PAID. 
    - Attempts to mark future months or months before enrolment will be rejected.
    - Updates the `FeeTracker` via `Model#markPaid()` and refreshes the UI.

2. **FeeMarkUnpaidCommand (triggered by `fee -up`)**: Marks a student’s fee as UNPAID for a specific month.
    - Validates that the student exists via `Model#getPersonById()`.
    - Validates that the target month falls between the student’s enrolled month and the current month (inclusive).
    - Tutors cannot mark future months or pre-enrolment months as Unpaid.
    - Updates the `FeeTracker` via `Model#markUnpaid()` and refreshes the UI.

3. **FeeFilterPaidCommand (triggered by `filter -p`)**: Filters students who have Paid for a specified month.
    - Validates that the input month is valid and not in the future.
    - Updates the filtered student list to display only students marked as PAID for that month.

4. **FeeFilterUnpaidCommand (triggered by `filter -up`)**: Filters students who have not Paid (Unpaid) for a specified month.
    - Validates that the input month is valid and not in the future.
    - Updates the filtered student list to display only students marked as UNPAID for that month.

5. **FeeViewCommand (triggered by `fee -v`)**: Displays a student’s payment history across a specified range of months.
    - Validates that the student exists and that the month range is valid.
    - Retrieves payment data using `FeeTracker#getPaymentHistory()`.
    - Outputs a reverse-chronological list of months (latest month first), with corresponding fee states.

<puml src="diagrams/FeeMarkPaidSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="FeeMarkPaidSequenceDiagram" />

#### Design Considerations

**Aspect: Sequential Payment Enforcement (Marking later months as PAID)**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Require all previous months to be PAID before a tutor can mark a later month as PAID.
    * Pros:
      - Reflects real-world payment flow — students should settle earlier dues before paying for upcoming lessons.
      - Prevents skipped or inconsistent payment sequences, such as marking August as PAID while July remains UNPAID.
      - Ensures data integrity — once a month is marked PAID, all earlier months are guaranteed to be cleared.
      - Simplifies validation and reporting, since the payment timeline always progresses forward without gaps.
      - Makes it easy to determine a student’s most recent paid month at a glance.

    * Cons:
      - Tutors cannot record payments out of sequence (e.g., skipping July and paying for August directly).
      - Adds a small validation step when marking multiple months.

* **Alternative 2:** Allow tutors to mark any month as PAID, regardless of whether earlier months are still UNPAID.
    * Pros:
        - Provides maximum flexibility for unusual or irregular payment situations.
        - Allows quick entry for multiple months without enforcing chronological checks.

    * Cons:
      - Can result in gaps or inconsistencies in the payment timeline — e.g., later months marked PAID while earlier ones remain UNPAID.
      - Makes it easier for tutors to overlook unpaid months, leading to incomplete financial records.
      - Reduces data reliability, since it becomes unclear whether all payments up to a given point have been fully settled.

**Aspect: Future Month Restriction (Advance Payments)**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Restrict marking months that are beyond the current calendar month.
    * Pros:
      - Prevents premature or speculative payments, maintaining realistic, time-based validation.
      - Keeps the system aligned with actual payment periods and avoids confusion with future billing.
      - Simplifies error handling and prevents data entry mistakes.

    * Cons:
      - Tutors cannot record advance payments for future months, even if a student has pre-paid.
      - May require future system updates to support legitimate early payments.

* **Alternative 2:** Allow tutors to mark future months as PAID, provided that all previous months have already been settled.
    * Pros:
      - Supports prepaid tuition scenarios, where students pay several months in advance.
      - Convenient for tutors managing long-term payment plans or scheduling future billing cycles in advance.
      - Reduces repetitive data entry when tutors want to record multiple future payments at once.

    * Cons:
      - Increases the risk of accidental marking of future months, especially if tutors mistype the month or forget the current date.
      - Requires additional validation safeguards (e.g., confirmation prompts or warning messages) to prevent unintentional future entries.
      - Adds complexity to the FeeViewCommand logic, since it must distinguish between completed months and prepaid future months when displaying fee history.

**Aspect: Backdated Correction (Marking an earlier month as UNPAID)**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Allow tutors to mark an earlier month as UNPAID, even if later months are already PAID.
    * Pros:
      - Supports real-world correction scenarios — e.g., the tutor realizes a payment was incorrectly recorded.
      - Allows quick edits without needing to unmark all subsequent months first.
      - Keeps flexibility: once corrected, the tutor must still settle earlier UNPAID months before new payments are accepted.

    * Cons:
      - May cause a temporary inconsistency (e.g., later months PAID while an earlier one is UNPAID) until resolved.
      - Might confuse tutors reviewing the timeline during the correction phase.

* **Alternative 2:** Block marking an earlier month as UNPAID if any later month is already PAID.
    * Pros:
      - Maintains a strictly chronological payment timeline with no anomalies.
      - Simplifies record validation and summary generation.

    * Cons:
      - Restrictive — tutors cannot fix genuine mis-entries without first unmarking all later months.

**Aspect: Display Order of Payment History**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Display payment history in reverse-chronological order (newest-first).  
  The computed range still spans from the effective start month (typically the enrolment month) up to the **current month**.

    * Pros:
        - Places the most relevant and recent months at the top, matching tutor workflows.
        - Reduces scrolling effort for checking recent payments or following up on unpaid students.
        - Maintains consistency across panels (e.g., performance notes), which also prioritize recent data.

    * Cons:
        - Tutors reviewing long-term records need to scroll to the bottom to reach the **earliest (enrolment) months**.


* **Alternative 2:** Display payment history in chronological order (oldest-first).  
  The earliest month (enrolment) appears first, progressing toward the current month.

    * Pros:
        - Provides a narratively intuitive timeline, helping tutors review payment history from the student’s start date.

    * Cons:
        - Recent months, which tutors most often need, appear at the bottom — requiring extra scrolling.
        - Inconsistent with other panels that already emphasize newest-first ordering.

#### Error Handling

Fee Management includes comprehensive validation across all operations:

**Marking Fees**
- Invalid or missing `StudentId`
- Month before enrolment or after the current month is invalid
- Attempting to mark Paid when already Paid
- Attempting to mark Unpaid when already Unpaid
- Attempting to mark Paid while an earlier month remains Unpaid

**Filtering Fees**
- Invalid or future month input

**Viewing Fee History**
- Invalid `StudentId`
- Invalid or future start month
- No payment data available

Each validation error produces clear and descriptive messages to guide user correction.

## **Planned Enhancements**

**Team size:** 5

Given below is a list of enhancements we plan to implement in future versions of Tuto:

1. **Bulk attendance marking for entire class:** Currently, tutors must mark attendance for each student individually using `att -p s/STUDENT_ID d/DATE t/CLASS`. For a class with 20-30 students, this becomes tedious and time-consuming. We plan to add a bulk marking feature that allows tutors to mark attendance for all students in a specific class at once. For example, `att -pA d/10112025 t/Math` would mark all students as present enrolled in the Math ClassTag as present for that date. This would significantly reduce the time needed to take attendance at the beginning of each lesson.
2. **Bulk deletion of old attendance records:** Currently, attendance records accumulate indefinitely, and tutors can only delete them one by one using `att -d s/STUDENT_ID d/DATE t/CLASS`. For students enrolled for extended periods (e.g., multiple years), their attendance lists can become very long and cluttered with old records that are no longer relevant for day-to-day tutoring. We plan to add a bulk deletion feature that allows tutors to remove attendance records older than a specified date or within a date range. For example, `att -clear d/BEFORE_DATE` or `att -clear d/FROM_DATE d/TO_DATE` would remove old records in bulk. This would help tutors maintain clean, relevant data while preserving important recent attendance history, improving both performance and usability when viewing attendance records.
3. **Individual class tag assignment and unassignment on top of current add/edit:** Currently, when editing a student's class tags using the edit command, all existing tags are replaced with the new list provided (or cleared if t/ is empty). This makes it cumbersome to add or remove a single tag without re-specifying all others. We plan to introduce new commands tag -assign s/STUDENT_ID t/TAG_NAME and tag -unassign s/STUDENT_ID t/TAG_NAME that allow adding or removing individual tags without affecting previously assigned ones. For example, tag -assign s/0001 t/Sec_3_A_Math would add the "Sec_3_A_Math" tag to student 0001 if they don't already have it, leaving other tags intact. Similarly, tag -unassign s/0001 t/Sec_3_A_Math would remove only that tag. Success messages would confirm the action, e.g., "Successfully assigned class tag [Sec_3_A_Math] to student ID 0001." Error messages would handle cases like non-existent students or tags. This enhancement addresses the frequent need for precise, incremental changes to student records, improving tutor workflow efficiency.
4. **ClassTag renaming:** Currently, once a ClassTag is created, its name cannot be changed. If a tutor wishes to rename a ClassTag (e.g., from "Sec_3_A_Math" to "Sec_3_A_Advanced_Math"), they must delete the existing ClassTag and create a new one. This process is cumbersome and risks losing the association with students if not handled carefully. We plan to implement a `tag -r` command that allows tutors to rename an existing ClassTag while preserving all student associations. For example, `tag -r oldt/Sec_3_A_Math newt/Sec_3_A_Advanced_Math` would rename the ClassTag accordingly. This feature would enhance flexibility in managing class names as course structures evolve.
5. **Introduce third fee state — WAIVED/SKIPPED:**  
   At present, fee tracking uses only two states: **PAID** and **UNPAID**.  
   In future releases, we plan to introduce a third state, **WAIVED** (or **SKIPPED**), to handle non-billable months such as holidays, term breaks, or periods without lessons.  
   This enhancement will:
    - Accurately reflect months when no tuition fees are due.
    - Allow tutors to “skip” months without breaking the sequential payment validation rule.
    - Improve clarity in fee reports by distinguishing “not billed” months from “unpaid” ones.

   This addition will also enhance flexibility in long-term record management and improve real-world applicability for tutoring scenarios involving variable schedules.
6. **Integrate Fee and Attendance Systems:**  
   Currently, fee tracking and attendance operate independently.  
   We plan to introduce light integration between both modules to make payment tracking more context-aware.

    - When viewing a student’s fee history, tutors will also see the **number of lessons held** for each month.
    - When marking a month as **PAID** with no recorded attendance, the system will show a **confirmation prompt** to avoid mistakes.
    - When marking a month as **UNPAID** while lessons are recorded, a **reminder** will appear to alert the tutor of possible inconsistencies.
    - Months **without any recorded attendance** will automatically be assigned a **WAIVED** status instead of UNPAID, ensuring skipped months (e.g., holidays or term breaks) do not block future payments.
   This enhancement improves **accuracy** and **consistency** between financial and attendance records, while keeping full flexibility for tutors to override when necessary.
7. **Unified student history view (view s/STUDENT_ID):** Introduce a consolidated view command that shows every performance note, attendance record, and fee transaction for the specified student, allowing tutors to review a learner’s full journey without hopping between modules.
8. **Targeted performance and attendance filters (perf -v / att -v):** Extend the existing view flags to accept optional m/MMYY or t/CLASS_TAG parameters so tutors can zero in on a specific month or class when analysing historical performance or attendance data.

### Non-Functional Requirements

1.  Should work on any _mainstream OS_ as long as it has Java `17` or above installed.
2.  Should be able to hold up to 1000 students without a noticeable sluggishness in performance for typical usage.
3.  A user with above average typing speed for regular English text (i.e. not code) should be able to accomplish most of the tasks faster using commands than using the mouse.
4.  The application should operate entirely offline, without requiring a database server or internet connection.
5.  The system should operate without requiring additional libraries.
6.  Data integrity must be maintained, ensuring no loss or duplication of records after operations or application restarts.
7.  The application should run locally on the user’s device.
8.  The system should be packaged into a single executable JAR file ≤ 200 MB, requiring no installer.
9.  User documentation should be clear and concise for beginners.
10. The application shall follow object-oriented design principles, allowing new commands or modules to be added with minimal changes to existing code.

### Glossary

* **Mainstream OS**: Windows, Linux, Unix, macOS
* **Private contact detail**: A contact detail that is not meant to be shared with others
* **Student ID**: A 4-digit unique numeric identifier (0000–9999) assigned to each student when added to the system.
* **Payment History**: A record covering a range from a start month (either the student’s enrolment month or an explicitly provided m/MMYY) up to the current month (inclusive). The UI displays this range in reverse-chronological order (newest month first). Months after enrolment with no explicit record are derived as UNPAID by default.
* **Performance note**: A short textual record of a student's performance on a given date
* **Attendance History**: A record that shows a student's attendance history, covering up to the six most recent months before the current month.
* **Executable JAR**: A Java Archive file that contains all compiled classes and resources, which can be run directly without installation.
