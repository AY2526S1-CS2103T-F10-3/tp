## **Design**

### Architecture

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.puml" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.puml" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<puml src="diagrams/ComponentManagers.puml" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

<puml src="diagrams/UiClassDiagram.puml" alt="Structure of the UI Component"/>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/LogicClassDiagram.puml" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</box>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<puml src="diagrams/ParserClasses.puml" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<puml src="diagrams/ModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores a list of `ClassTag` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueClassTagList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

**ClassTag Management:**
- Each `ClassTag` has a unique name that identifies a class or group
- `UniqueClassTagList` ensures no duplicate ClassTag names exist
- Students can be assigned multiple ClassTags via the `classTags` field in `Person`
- When a ClassTag is deleted, it must not be assigned to any student
- ClassTags provide a way to filter and organize students by class tag

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `ClassTag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `ClassTag` object per unique class tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `ClassTag` objects.<br>

<puml src="diagrams/BetterModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />

</box>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<puml src="diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.puml" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)
* handles the `UniqueClassTagList` by saving/loading it as part of the `AddressBook` data. `JSONAdaptedClassTag` is used to convert between the `ClassTag` model type and its JSON-friendly format. `JSONSerializableAddressBook` includes the `classTags` list during serialization and deserialization. 

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Student Management

#### Overview

The Student Management feature allows tutors to manage student records efficiently.  
Key operations include **adding, editing, and deleting students**.

Each student is uniquely identified by a **Student ID** and can have associated attributes such as **name, phone, email, address, and ClassTags**.

---

#### Implementation

**Model Component:**
- `Person`: Represents a student with immutable fields:
    - Name, Phone, Email, Address, ClassTags, StudentId, AttendanceList, PerformanceList
- `StudentId`: Ensures uniqueness of students
- `Model` interface provides methods:
    - `addPerson(Person)`: Adds a student
    - `setPerson(Person, Person)`: Updates a student record
    - `deletePerson(Person)`: Deletes a student
    - `hasPerson(Person)`: Checks for duplicate student
    - `hasPersonWithId(StudentId)`: Checks existence of student by ID
    - `getPersonById(StudentId)`: Retrieves student by ID
- `AttendanceList` and `PerformanceList` maintain attendance and performance records

**Storage Component:**
- `JsonAdaptedPerson`: Converts Person objects to/from JSON
- `JsonSerializableAddressBook`: Serializes the student list along with ClassTag references
- Deserialization ensures ClassTag references are restored for each student

**Logic Component:**

1. **AddCommand (`add`)**: Adds a new student
    - Validates all fields (Name, Phone, Email, Address)
    - Ensures no duplicate students
    - Checks all ClassTags exist before assignment
    - Automatically assigns a unique Student ID
    - Updates the model with the new student

2. **EditCommand (`edit`)**: Modifies existing student details
    - Identifies student by Student ID
    - Edits any combination of fields (Name, Phone, Email, Address, ClassTags)
    - Validates all input fields and ClassTags
    - Empty ClassTag list (`t/`) removes all ClassTag assignments
    - Prevents duplicate records after editing

3. **DeleteCommand (`delete`)**: Removes a student
    - Identifies student by Student ID
    - Ensures the student exists before deletion
    - Updates model to remove the student

---

#### Sequence Diagrams

**3. Deleting a Student (`delete`)**
<puml src="diagrams/DeleteStudentSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="DeleteStudentSequenceDiagram" />

---

#### Design Considerations

**Aspect: Unique Student Identification**
- **Choice:** Use `StudentId` as a unique identifier
    - Pros:
        - Ensures uniqueness across all students
        - Simplifies operations like edit and delete
        - Auto-generation reduces manual errors
    - Cons:
        - Requires management of next available ID

**Aspect: Integration with ClassTags**
- **Choice:** Assign ClassTags during Add/Edit commands
    - Pros:
        - Reduces number of steps for tutors
        - Maintains referential integrity with `UniqueClassTagList`
    - Cons:
        - Increases responsibility of Add/Edit commands
        - Slightly more complex validation

**Aspect: Command Design**
- **Choice:** Separate commands for Add, Edit, Delete
    - Pros:
        - Clear responsibilities
        - Easy to maintain and extend
    - Cons:
        - Tutors need to remember three commands (mitigated by clear usage instructions)

---

#### Error Handling

**Adding Students:**
- Duplicate student record
- Invalid or missing field(s)
- Non-existent ClassTags
- Maximum number of students exceeded (StudentId > 9999)

**Editing Students:**
- Student ID not found
- No fields provided to edit
- Invalid input fields or ClassTags
- Resulting record duplicates an existing student

**Deleting Students:**
- Student ID not found
- Invalid command format

**General Validation Rules:**
- Fields are trimmed and validated according to their respective rules
- Commands reject extra/unrecognized input
- All validation errors provide **clear, actionable feedback** to the user

### ClassTag Management

#### Overview

The ClassTag feature allows tutors to organize students into classes or groups. Each ClassTag represents a distinct class (e.g., "Sec_3_A_Math", "P5_Science") that can be assigned to multiple students.

#### Implementation

ClassTag management is implemented through several key components:

**Model Component:**
- `ClassTag`: Represents a class with a unique name
- `UniqueClassTagList`: Maintains all ClassTags in the system, ensuring no duplicates
- The `Model` interface provides methods:
    - `hasClassTag(ClassTag)`: Checks if a ClassTag exists
    - `addClassTag(ClassTag)`: Adds a new ClassTag
    - `deleteClassTag(ClassTag)`: Removes a ClassTag
    - `findClassTag(String)`: Finds and returns a ClassTag by its name
- `Person` objects maintain a `Set<ClassTag>` field that references ClassTags from the central `UniqueClassTagList`
  
**Storage Component:**
- `JsonAdaptedClassTag`: Converts ClassTag objects to/from JSON format for persistence
- `JsonSerializableAddressBook`: Serializes both the central ClassTag list and student-ClassTag associations
- ClassTags are persisted in two ways:
    1. As a complete list in the `classTags` field of the address book
    2. As references within each student's `tags` field
- During deserialization, ClassTags are loaded first into the system, then students reference them by name

**Logic Component:**

The following commands handle ClassTag operations:

1. **AddClassTagCommand (triggered by `tag -a`)**: Creates a new ClassTag in the system
    - Validates the ClassTag name format (1-30 alphanumeric characters and underscores)
    - Checks for duplicates via `Model#hasClassTag()`
    - Adds to `UniqueClassTagList` via `Model#addClassTag()`

2. **DeleteClassTagCommand (triggered by `tag -d`)**: Deletes an existing ClassTag
    - Validates the ClassTag exists
    - Ensures no students are currently assigned to it
    - Removes from `UniqueClassTagList` via `Model#deleteClassTag()`

3. **ListClassTagCommand (triggered by `tag -l`)**: Lists all ClassTags in the system
    - Retrieves all ClassTags from the Model
    - Displays them in a numbered list

4. **ClassTagFilterCommand (triggered by `filter -t`)**: Filters students by ClassTag
    - Validates the ClassTag exists via `Model#findClassTag()`
    - Updates the filtered person list to show only students with that ClassTag

5. **AddCommand**: Adds a new student with optional ClassTag assignments
    - Validates all specified ClassTags exist before creating the student
    - Links student to ClassTags via references

6. **EditCommand**: Edits student details including ClassTag assignments
    - Can add, remove, or replace ClassTag assignments
    - Validates all ClassTags exist before updating
    - Empty ClassTag list (`t/`) removes all ClassTag assignments

#### Sequence Diagram: Adding a ClassTag

The following sequence diagram illustrates the interactions between components when a tutor creates a new ClassTag using the `tag -a` command:

<puml src="diagrams/AddClassTagSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="AddClassTagSequenceDiagram" />

#### Design Considerations

**Aspect: ClassTag Storage Architecture:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Central storage in `UniqueClassTagList` with student references
    * Pros:
        - Single source of truth for all ClassTags
        - Enforces uniqueness at system level
        - Prevents orphaned or duplicate ClassTag names
        - Easy to list all classes in the system
        - Referential integrity - can prevent deletion of in-use ClassTags
    * Cons:
        - Requires additional validation when assigning ClassTags to students
        - Slightly more complex implementation

* **Alternative 2:** Store ClassTags only within each Student object
    * Pros:
        - Simpler data structure
        - No need for separate ClassTag list
        - Automatic cleanup when student is deleted
    * Cons:
        - No centralized management or validation
        - Potential for duplicate ClassTag names with slight variations
        - Cannot list all classes without scanning all students
        - Cannot enforce consistent naming
        - No way to track which classes exist in the system

**Aspect: ClassTag Command Design:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Single `tag` command with flags (`-a`, `-d`, `-l`)
    * Pros:
        - Consolidates related operations under one command word
        - Reduces the number of top-level commands users need to remember
        - Clear semantic grouping of ClassTag operations
        - Single ClassTagCommandParser handles all tag operations, reducing parser classes and maintaining consistency
    * Cons:
        - More complex parsing logic to handle different flags

* **Alternative 2:** Separate commands (`addtag`, `deletetag`, `listtag`)
    * Pros:
        - Simpler individual parsers
        - No flag parsing needed
    * Cons:
        - More top-level commands to remember
        - Less semantic grouping

**Aspect: ClassTag Assignment Workflow:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Integrate with Add and Edit commands
    * Pros:
        - Fewer commands for users to learn
        - Natural workflow - assign classes when creating/modifying students
        - Reduces command clutter
    * Cons:
        - Add and Edit commands have more responsibilities
        - More complex command parsing

* **Alternative 2:** Separate AssignClassTag and UnassignClassTag commands
    * Pros:
        - Single responsibility per command
        - Simpler individual command implementations
    * Cons:
        - More commands for users to remember
        - Extra steps in workflow (create student, then assign classes)
        - Verbose for bulk operations

#### Error Handling

ClassTag operations include comprehensive validation:

**Creating ClassTags:**
- Duplicate ClassTag names (case-insensitive)
- Invalid ClassTag name format (must be 1-30 alphanumeric characters with underscores, no spaces)
- Empty ClassTag name
- Missing or invalid flag

**Deleting ClassTags:**
- Non-existent ClassTag
- ClassTag still assigned to one or more students
- Invalid command format
- Invalid ClassTag format

**Assigning ClassTags to Students:**
- Non-existent ClassTag name when adding/editing students
- Invalid ClassTag format in student commands
- Attempting to assign a ClassTag that doesn't exist

**Filtering by ClassTag:**
- Non-existent ClassTag name
- Invalid command format
- Invalid ClassTag format

**General Validation Rules:**
- All tag commands enforce **strict parameter checking** â€” any extra text beyond the expected format is rejected
- When multiple flags are present, only the **first valid flag** determines the command type; subsequent flags are treated as invalid parameters and cause the command to fail
- Tag names are trimmed of leading/trailing whitespace before validation

Each validation error provides clear, actionable feedback to help users correct their input.

### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`. It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()`â€‰â€”â€‰Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState0.puml" alt="UndoRedoState0" />

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState1.puml" alt="UndoRedoState1" />

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David â€¦â€‹` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState2.puml" alt="UndoRedoState2" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

</box>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState3.puml" alt="UndoRedoState3" />


<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial AddressBook state, then there are no previous AddressBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</box>

The following sequence diagram shows how an undo operation goes through the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/UndoSequenceDiagram-Logic.puml" alt="UndoSequenceDiagram-Logic" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</box>

Similarly, how an undo operation goes through the `Model` component is shown below:

<puml src="diagrams/UndoSequenceDiagram-Model.puml" alt="UndoSequenceDiagram-Model" />

The `redo` command does the oppositeâ€‰â€”â€‰it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone AddressBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</box>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState4.puml" alt="UndoRedoState4" />

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David â€¦â€‹` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState5.puml" alt="UndoRedoState5" />

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<puml src="diagrams/CommitActivityDiagram.puml" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.
