# Tuto User Guide

Tuto is a **desktop app for managing contacts, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, Tuto can get your contact management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

<!-- * Table of Contents -->
<page-nav-print />

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java `17` or above installed in your Computer.<br>
   **Mac users:** Ensure you have the precise JDK version prescribed [here](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/javaInstallationMac.html).

1. Download the latest `.jar` file from [here](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/releases).

1. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your AddressBook.

1. Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder you put the jar file in, and use the `java -jar tuto.jar` command to run the application.<br>
   A GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>
   ![Ui](images/Ui.png)

1. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

   * `list` : Lists all students.

   * `add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01` : Adds a student named `John Doe` to Tuto.

   * `clear` : Deletes all contacts.

   * `exit` : Exits the app.

1. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Features

<box type="info" seamless>

**Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Each student added will be automatically assigned a unique `Student ID` in a 4-digit format, which is used to identify the student for edit and delete commands.
  e.g. `0020`, `2413`

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/CLASS_TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/Math` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/CLASS_TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/Math`, `t/Math t/Science` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters and flags (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

Format: `tag -a t/TAG_NAME`

Command Details and Constraints:
* This command creates a new class tag with the specified `TAG_NAME`.
* If a tag with the same name (case-insensitive) already exists, the command will not create a duplicate and will inform the user.
* Tag names must be 1\-30 characters long and can only contain alphanumeric characters and underscores (`_`). Spaces or other special characters are not allowed.
* Tag names are case\-insensitive when checking for duplicates, but the original casing is preserved when added.

## Payment Management
The Payment Management Commands allows you to **record, update, and view student payment statuses**.  
This helps tutors and administrators track monthly tuition fee payments efficiently and keep student records up to date.
<box type="info" seamless>

**Overview of fee commands**

| Command                        | Description                                         |
|--------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| `fee -p s/STUDENT_ID m/MMYY`   | Marks a student as **PAID** for a specified month   |
| `fee -up s/STUDENT_ID m/MMYY`  | Marks a student as **UNPAID** for a specified month |
| `fee -v s/STUDENT_ID [m/MMYY]` | Views a student’s **payment history**               |
</box>

#### Payment Rules

When marking a student’s fee as **Paid** or **Unpaid**, the following rules apply:

1. **Valid month range**  
   You can only mark payments for months **between the student’s enrollment month and the current month (inclusive)**.
    - Payments **before enrollment** are invalid and will be rejected.
    - **Future payments** (months after the current month) are not allowed and will result in an error message.

2. **Sequential payment requirement**  
   Payments must be made **in chronological order**.
    - If there are **unpaid months before** the selected month, you **cannot** mark the later month as paid.
    - For example, if September 2025 remains unpaid, you must pay for September before marking October 2025 as paid.

3. **Duplicate payment prevention**  
   If a month has **already been marked as Paid**, the system will reject duplicate payment attempts and display an error message indicating that the month is already paid.

<div class="tip">
💡 These rules ensure that payment records remain consistent, logical, and accurately reflect each student’s fee history.
</div>

### 1. Marking a student as PAID: `fee -p`

Marks a student’s payment status as **PAID** for a specific month.

**Format:** fee -p s/STUDENT_ID m/MMYY

**Examples:**
- `fee -p s/0001 m/0925` — marks student `0001`(Bernice Yu) as **paid** for **September 2025**.
- `fee -p s/0003 m/0825` — marks student `0003`(David Li) as **paid** for **August 2025**.

**Expected output:**  
`Bernice Yu has been successfully marked as Paid for September 2025.`  
or  
`October 2025 is already marked as Paid.`  
or  
`Cannot mark October 2025 as Paid.
June 2025 is not Paid yet.`  
or  
`You can’t mark paid for a future month. Please try again when the month has started.`  
or  
`Cannot mark payment: Alex Yeoh's enrolment started in August 2025.
Earlier months cannot be marked.`

### 2. Marking a student as UNPAID: `fee -up`

Marks a student’s payment status as **UNPAID** for one specific month.  
Use this for corrections or when a payment was previously marked as paid but has not been settled.

**Format:** fee -up s/STUDENT_ID m/MMYY

**Examples:**
- `fee -up s/0001 m/0925` — marks student `0001`(Bernice Yu) as **unpaid** for **September 2025**.
- `fee -up s/0003 m/0825` — marks student `0003`(David Li) as **unpaid** for **August 2025**.

**Expected output:**  
`Bernice Yu has been successfully marked as Unpaid for September 2025.`  
or  
`October 2025 is already unpaid.`  
or  
`Cannot mark payment: Alex Yeoh's enrolment started in August 2025.
Earlier months cannot be marked.`  
or  
`You can’t mark unpaid for a future month. Please try again when the month has started.`


### 3. Viewing a student’s payment history:

Displays a student’s payment history from a starting month up to the current month.

**Format:** fee -v s/STUDENT_ID [m/MMYY]

**Examples:**
- `fee -v s/0001` — shows payment history for student `0001` from their enrollment month to the current month.
- `fee -v s/0001 m/0525` — shows payment history starting **May 2025** to the current month.


<box type="tip" seamless>

If the starting month is not provided or the starting month provided precedes the
student's enrollment month, the history will start from the student's enrollment month.   
If the provided month is **after the current month**, the command will return an error message.
</box>

**Expected Output:**  
`Payment history for Alex Yeoh from August 2025 to October 2025 (3 months)`  
`Enrolled Month: August 2025`  
`August 2025 : PAID (marked)`  
`September 2025 : PAID (marked)`  
`October 2025 : UNPAID (default)`  
or  
`Cannot display payment history for future months.`  
`Please select a month up to the current month.`
<box type="info" seamless>

**Interpreting the results:**
- `marked` — the payment was explicitly set (via `fee -p` or `fee -up`).
- `default` — the month had no explicit record and is assumed **UNPAID**.

</box>

## Filter students: `filter`

The `filter` command allows you to quickly find students based on specific criteria such as **payment status** or **class tags**.  
This is useful for tutors and administrators who want to check which students
have paid or are unpaid for a given month, or to focus on a specific class group.

### Overview

Filtering supports three main types of criteria:

| Flag  | Meaning                                               | Example                  |
|-------|-------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|
| `-p`  | Show students marked as **PAID** for a specific month | `filter -p m/1025`       |
| `-up` | Show students marked (or defaulted) as **UNPAID**     | `filter -up m/1125`      |
| `-t`  | Show students belonging to a particular **class tag** | `filter -t t/Sec3_Maths` |

You can only use **one flag** per command.  
Each filter updates the main student list view to display only matching entries.

### Filter by PAID status : `filter -p`

Shows all students whose payment status is **PAID** for a given month.  
You can only filter up to the **current month** (future months are not allowed).

**Format:**  
filter -p m/MMYY

**Example:**  
filter -p m/1025

<box type="tip" seamless>
 
If the provided month is **after the current month**, the command will return an error message.
</box>

**Expected Output:**  
`Showing PAID students for October 2025.`  
`3 persons listed!`  
or  
`Cannot filter by future months.`  
`Please select a month up to the current month.`


### Filter by UNPAID status : `filter -up`

Shows all students whose payment status is **UNPAID** for a given month.  
You can only filter up to the **current month** (future months are not allowed).

**Format:**  
filter -up m/MMYY

**Example:**  
filter -up m/1025

<box type="info" seamless>
If a student has never been explicitly marked as PAID, their status is treated as **UNPAID by default**.
</box>

**Expected Output:**  
`Showing UNPAID students for October 2025.`
`3 persons listed!`  
or  
`Cannot filter by future months.`  
`Please select a month up to the current month.`

### Filtering persons by class tag : `filter -t`

Filters the main list to show only persons who are assigned the specified class tag.

Format: filter -t t/TAG_NAME

Command Details and Constraints:
* The class tag must already exist in the system. 
* Tag name matching is case\-insensitive.

Examples:
- filter -t t/Sec3_Maths — Shows only students who have the Sec3_Maths tag.
- filter -t t/jc1_physics — Shows only students who have the JC1_Physics tag.

Expected output:
![filterByClassTag.jpg](images/filterByClassTag.jpg)

## Managing students' attendance: `att`

### Saving the data

AddressBook data are saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.

### Editing the data file

AddressBook data are saved automatically as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/addressbook.json`. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

<box type="warning" seamless>

**Caution:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, AddressBook will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run.  Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.<br>
Furthermore, certain edits can cause the AddressBook to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous AddressBook home folder.

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
2. **If you minimize the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy is to manually restore the minimized Help Window.
